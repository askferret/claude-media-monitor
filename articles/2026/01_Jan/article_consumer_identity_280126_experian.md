  The 2026 consumer is reconsidering how they want to engage with businesses. Research from Nielsen anticipates that in 2026, people will spend more intentionally, think more critically, and expect more from the brands they invite into their lives. They want clear value, marketing experiences that make decisions easier, and personalization that respects their privacy.

  Consumers are going into 2026 feeling deeply cautious. According to 2026 consumer outlook data, 32.8% of global shoppers say they're financially worse off than last year, and 73% of those consumers cite rising cost-of-living pressures. People are spending, but directing most dollars toward core categories like food, health, and household care. Economic stability will outweigh values: environmental concerns fell from #4 global worry to #9 in 2025, while financial pressures and geopolitical issues moved to the top. People still care about brand values, but economic stability is becoming a stronger driver.

  Consumers will prioritize value, simplicity, and relevance—transparent pricing, clear benefits, recommendations aligned to budget and needs, frictionless decision paths. They want personalization on their terms: 64% prefer personalized experiences, but 39% say benefits outweigh privacy trade-offs and 32% feel uncomfortable with many data-driven personalization tactics. First-party data is now the foundation of meaningful, privacy-first engagement.

  Omnichannel behavior and real-time micro-moments will define how people shop. Consumers don't differentiate between channels; they want a seamless journey. People shop more frequently but purchase fewer items per trip—more small, mission-driven decisions, often triggered by digital or mobile discovery. Generational dynamics shape discovery, evaluation, and buying: Gen Z expects transparency, authenticity, and digital ease; Millennials seek value alignment and reliability; Gen X is increasingly digital, highly value-conscious, and loyal. Trust is the new currency: clear data practices, transparent value exchanges, confidence that brands honor preferences.

  Experian's 2026 consumer outlook argues that consumers are spending more intentionally and cautiously, prioritizing economic stability over values (e.g. environmental concerns dropped in priority). They want value, simplicity, relevance, and personalization on privacy-first terms. Omnichannel and micro-moments define shopping; trust and first-party data are central. Generational differences in transparency, value, and digital behavior are highlighted, with Experian positioning identity resolution and audience intelligence as the response.
