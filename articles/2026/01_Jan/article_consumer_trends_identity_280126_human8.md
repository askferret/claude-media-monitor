  The key consumer trends for 2026 reveal a shift in how people define who they are and what matters to them. Based on Human8 and Space Doctors global research, eight emerging trends highlight how evolving identities are influencing consumer behaviour and choices in 2026.

  We live in a world of contradictions. Global research shows many people report feeling happy (67%), but fewer trust institutions (46%). Optimism today (57%) sits alongside doubt about the future, with only 45% believing the next generation will be better off. Technology reflects this divide: 76% believe it makes life easier and 54% experience AI positively, while 64% worry technology will erode the human touch and 61% are concerned about its impact on society. These contradictions sit at the heart of "Recalibrating identities," the central theme of the 2026 What matters report. Identity is becoming more intentional. Belonging more self-defined. Success more openly earned.

  Eight consumer trends: (1) Human pride—reclaiming the human touch, creativity, craft, emotion, imperfection; 76% believe human creativity will always matter more than machine-made outputs. (2) Hyper blanding—54% say everything feels the same; a quiet movement reclaiming individuality and authenticity. (3) The achievement zone—spotlighting the grind and the messy middle; 73% say achievement is about openly showing the work. (4) Health unscripted—wellbeing on your own terms; 78% agree there's no single right way to be healthy. (5) Shouting economy—67% believe only striking voices get noticed; attention as currency, but authenticity and meaningful engagement remain the prize. (6) Future tradition—traditions as living, evolving practices; 66% agree traditions stay alive when they evolve. (7) Retail fandom—belonging over buying; 52% say shopping is less about owning products and more about joining communities. (8) Lightspeed living—65% say the most valued options deliver immediate results; speed as control, competence, and calm.

  Human8's 2026 What matters report frames eight consumer trends under the theme "Recalibrating identities": people navigating contradiction by becoming more intentional about who they are, what they value, and how they belong. Trends include Human pride (reclaiming the human touch), Hyper blanding (reclaiming individuality amid sameness), The achievement zone (showing the work), Health unscripted (wellbeing on own terms), Shouting economy (attention and authenticity), Future tradition (evolving traditions), Retail fandom (community over product), and Lightspeed living (immediate results and control). Research draws on 20 years of cultural tracking and 13,000+ consumers across 16 markets.

## Summary

The key consumer trends for 2026 reveal a shift in how people define who they are and what matters to them. Based on Human8 and Space Doctors global research, eight emerging trends highlight how evolving identities are influencing consumer behaviour and choices in 2026.

We live in a world of contradictions. Global research shows many people report feeling happy (67%), but fewer trust institutions (46%).
