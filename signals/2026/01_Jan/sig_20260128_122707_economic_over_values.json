  "title": "Economic stability outweighing values in consumer decisions",
  "summary": "Consumers still care about brand values, but economic stability is becoming the stronger driver of what they buy, where they shop, and which brands they trust. Environmental concerns fell from #4 to #9 in global worries (2024–2025); financial and geopolitical pressures lead.",
  "detailed_analysis": "Experian cites Nielsen 2026 consumer outlook: 32.8% of global shoppers feel financially worse off than last year, and 73% of those cite rising cost-of-living pressures. People are spending but directing most dollars toward core categories (food, health, household care). The shift from values-led to economics-led decisions does not mean values disappear—consumers want brands to be responsible, fair, and transparent—but they expect values to align with financial reality. Implication for identity: how people 'recalibrate' and express identity through consumption is increasingly mediated by budget and value-for-money; brand meaning and belonging must fit within that constraint.",
