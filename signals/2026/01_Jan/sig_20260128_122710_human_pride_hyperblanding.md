## Summary

64% worry technology will erode the human touch; 76% believe human creativity, craft, and imperfection will always matter more than machine-made outputs. Simultaneously, 54% feel everything looks the same (hyper-blanding); a quiet movement is reclaiming individuality, edge, and authenticity.

## Detailed Analysis

Human8 frames two related 2026 trends. Human pride: people are rediscovering the value of creativity, craft, emotion, and imperfection—lopsided ceramics, off-script conversations, the 'spark, mess, and magic' that only humans create. AI may accelerate creation, but human imagination, connection, and meaning give it heart. Hyper-blanding: globalisation, hyper-connectedness, rapid trend cycles, and AI-fuelled replication make styles and ideas spread fast; 54% say from clothes to content, everything feels the same. That sameness offers comfort but also tension; a growing appetite for reclaiming individuality, edge, and authenticity is emerging. For consumer culture and identity: self-expression is partly a reaction against both automation and homogeneity—brands that stand for human craft, imperfection, or distinctiveness can align with this recalibration of identity.

## Implications

- Emphasise human craft, imperfection, or distinctiveness where credible; avoid generic or AI-sameness aesthetics.
- Offer ways to express individuality and edge without requiring premium price if targeting value-conscious consumers.
