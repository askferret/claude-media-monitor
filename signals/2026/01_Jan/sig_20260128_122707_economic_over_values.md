## Summary

Consumers still care about brand values, but economic stability is becoming the stronger driver of what they buy, where they shop, and which brands they trust. Environmental concerns fell from #4 to #9 in global worries (2024–2025); financial and geopolitical pressures lead.

## Detailed Analysis

Experian cites Nielsen 2026 consumer outlook: 32.8% of global shoppers feel financially worse off than last year, and 73% of those cite rising cost-of-living pressures. People are spending but directing most dollars toward core categories (food, health, household care). The shift from values-led to economics-led decisions does not mean values disappear—consumers want brands to be responsible, fair, and transparent—but they expect values to align with financial reality. Implication for identity: how people 'recalibrate' and express identity through consumption is increasingly mediated by budget and value-for-money; brand meaning and belonging must fit within that constraint.

## Implications

- Tailor messaging to financial reality by segment (stretched vs. flexible); avoid values-only positioning without value proof.
- Identity and belonging narratives should acknowledge budget and value, not only aspiration.
