  "title": "Trust as currency for identity and personalization",
  "summary": "Consumers want personalization on their terms: clear value exchange, control over data, and transparent privacy-first practices. Trust differentiates brands that earn attention, data, and loyalty; first-party data and identity resolution are framed as the foundation for that trust.",
  "detailed_analysis": "Experian and Human8 both emphasise that identity and self-expression through brands are contingent on trust. Experian: 64% prefer personalized experiences, but 39% say benefits outweigh privacy trade-offs and 32% feel uncomfortable with many data-driven tactics; first-party data is the foundation of meaningful, privacy-first engagement. Human8's 'recalibrating identities' theme implies people are more intentional about who they let into their identity construction—brands must earn the right to be part of that. Trust is not only data privacy: it includes transparent value, relevance without creepiness, and consistency across channels. For cultural analysts, the insight is that identity-based consumption is increasingly gated by trust; brands that fail on transparency or relevance are excluded from self-expressive choice.",
