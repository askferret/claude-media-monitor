  "title": "Recalibrating identities as central consumer theme in 2026",
  "summary": "Identity is becoming more intentional, belonging more self-defined, and success more openly earned. Consumers are navigating contradiction (happiness vs. low trust, optimism vs. doubt) and renegotiating what it means to belong, feel recognised, and stay true to themselves.",
  "detailed_analysis": "Human8's 2026 What matters report and Experian's 2026 consumer outlook both frame a shift in how people define who they are and what they want from brands. Global research shows 67% report feeling happy but only 46% trust institutions; 57% feel optimistic while 45% believe the next generation will be better off. Technology sharpens the divide: 76% believe it makes life easier and 54% experience AI positively, yet 64% worry technology will erode the human touch. This 'recalibrating identities' theme unites trend reports: consumers are spending and choosing more intentionally, expecting brands to align with their self-defined belonging and to deliver value, transparency, and relevance without overriding identity or privacy.",
