  "summary": "Shopping is increasingly framed as joining communities rather than owning products. 52% say shopping is less about owning products and more about joining communities; loyalty comes from participation, co-creation, and shared identity around brands and categories.",
  "detailed_analysis": "Human8 names 'Retail fandom' as one of eight 2026 trends: people don't just want products, they want communities, experiences, and a chance to show what they love. Beauty, sneakers, gaming are cited as categories where fans connect, create, and celebrate together. Shopping, entertainment, and social media have collided; the best fandoms mix excitement with authenticity and value, offering spaces to co-create and engage while delivering quality and seamless experiences. This pattern aligns with 'recalibrating identities': belonging is self-defined and often expressed through participation in brand or category communities rather than through ownership alone. For cultural analysis, the signal is that identity-through-consumption is shifting from 'what I buy' to 'where I belong' and 'what I contribute'—brands that only sell product without community or participation risk being excluded from identity construction.",
