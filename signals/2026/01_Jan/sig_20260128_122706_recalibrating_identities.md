## Summary

Identity is becoming more intentional, belonging more self-defined, and success more openly earned. Consumers are navigating contradiction (happiness vs. low trust, optimism vs. doubt) and renegotiating what it means to belong, feel recognised, and stay true to themselves.

## Detailed Analysis

Human8's 2026 What matters report and Experian's 2026 consumer outlook both frame a shift in how people define who they are and what they want from brands. Global research shows 67% report feeling happy but only 46% trust institutions; 57% feel optimistic while 45% believe the next generation will be better off. Technology sharpens the divide: 76% believe it makes life easier and 54% experience AI positively, yet 64% worry technology will erode the human touch. This 'recalibrating identities' theme unites trend reports: consumers are spending and choosing more intentionally, expecting brands to align with their self-defined belonging and to deliver value, transparency, and relevance without overriding identity or privacy.

## Implications

- Position brand around self-defined belonging and earned success; avoid one-size-fits-all identity narratives.
- Emphasize transparency and relevance so consumers feel recognised without feeling surveilled.
